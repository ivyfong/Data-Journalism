# Unit 16 â€“ D3 Homework, Data Journalism

The objective of this project is to use D3 and JavaScript to create a scatterplot to present data from the US Census Bureau. The interactive graph allows users to choose which data to display. Users can pick between 3 demographic features for the x-axis (poverty, age, and income) and 3 health risk factors for the y-axis (lack of healthcare, obesity, and smoking). Each circle on the graph represents one state. Tooltips displaying the data selected are shown when users hover over each circle.
